# Chat Application
This is a simple real-time chat application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. It allows multiple users to connect, send messages, and see messages from other users instantly. The server listens for incoming connections and broadcasts any received messages to all connected clients. Each user can view messages from others in real time as they are sent. The application serves an HTML page for the chat interface, where users can type and send messages that are updated dynamically in the chatbox.
